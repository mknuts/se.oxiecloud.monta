# Monta EV Charger for Homey


Control your Monta connected EV charger from Homey.

To use this app you need to connect your EV charger to Montas backend (connection is free of charge
for private owned chargers).

You also need to register anapplication with Monta so that you can get access to their public API.
When registering you will get a Client ID and a Client secret, and you need these two parameters to be able
to use this app.
